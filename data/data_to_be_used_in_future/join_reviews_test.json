  "reviewText": "If you are a guy with testicles, you will like this book. The epic describes the adventures of a Viking, Orm, from his youth up until his last expedition. He never stays in one place for too long and is pretty much on the search for blood the the span of his lifetime. The only drawback to this book is the prattling priest, who tries to soften and dull the plot of Orm's awesome life. Push through the nagging priest part about 3/4 through the book, and you will find more bloody skulls on the other side. This is one of my favorite books of all time. It immerses you and you start to think like the author writes, because he writes in a slightly different way than we speak now. It does wonders for the brain to see this new kind of sentence structure. I think my brain grew from reading this book. The LongShips is inspiring, it makes you want to squeeze every last drop of adventure out of life as possible, to greet every stranger that walks in your path, befriend him and exploit him until your name is written with his blood on the Hall of Eternity.",

This hard to put down novel traces the life of Orm, a monumental Viking leader as he honorably battles the numerous enemies.  Within these pages we learn the code of the Norsemen, their honor and their formidable fighting ways. But all is not grimly told for there are flashes of humor, or at least what passes for Viking humor. For example, in the Viking view, a good fight to the death of one or both of the participants is certainly a worthy undertaking. Also, if one flags at the task of  rowing one of the long boats, then it is sensible to throw the slacker overboard. After reading this saga it is easy to understand why Norsemen were the rulers of Northern Europe for several centuries.  A great read.  Enjoy",

The primitive Danes and Swedes venture out for booty from richer and more civilized lands.  The advanced Moors of Spain teach their northern captives the pleasures of wealth and culture.  The hapless Irish and English fall victim to the ferocious Swedes, but turn the tables by influencing the primitives souls.  The pull of Christianity slowly spreads through the primitive land of the Swedes replacing their sylvan primitivism.  And finally, the little known incursions of the Northmen into Russia are described.It is a discussion of what it means to be advanced and civilized.  Written in the shadow of the Nazi invasion, it is a reflection on the nature of savagery and the meaning of Christian tolerance.This book deserves to be read by many, young and old.",

  "reviewText": "The Long Ships is a Viking saga of the highest order.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I've read some Viking era history and fiction and found this book to be quite accurate to how I imagined the period.  Red Orm is a likeable character and I couldn't wait to see how his story ended.  The four parts of the book made for good dividing points and good breaks in the story line.Orm is captured during a raid when a young man and forced to row on a Viking ship to take the place of the man he killed.  Once he becomes accepted by the crew his ship is captured by Muslim pirates and he is becomes a galley slave.  Eventually he is released and entered the service of Almunsar of Spain, as a member of his personal bodyguard.  When an opportunity arises Orm and his remaining crewmates escape and return home as rich men, with weapons and gold.  For a time he enters the service of King Harald, and he even goes to England as part of an invading force.  Towards the end of the book he travels to Kiev on a quest to recover a lost trove of Bulgar gold.As a Viking tale there is plenty of sailing, rowing, plunder, sword fighting, romance, and religion.  The religious context interested me a lot.  Orm is transformed from a young boy believing in traditional Northern gods, to a valuable soldier for a Muslim world leader; and finally became a Christian in order to marry.  He followed Allah when it benefited him and when he was in \"Allah's waters\" and later when he tries to convert his friend to Christianity he mixes up his theologies.  He became an off the cuff Christian, and decided that Jesus made him lucky.  As the book progresses he has a priest as a best friend and doctor, but he doesn't force Christianity on his friends.  He builds a church but still held on to many of the old ways.In conclusion, to echo Chambon's introduction \"it is really good.\"  I was swept up in the tale and felt like a shipmate on board ready for an adventure.  I wish Orm had more adventures so that the book would have lasted longer.  Definitely one I'll return to again.",

  "reviewText": "I heartily endorse all of the accolades heaped upon this novel by the other reviewers.  It is a rollicking good tale chock full of more adventure per page than any other book I can think of.  A good measure of ironic humor adds to the fun.However, the potential reader deserves a few observations absent from the other reviews.1. Episodic:  The book is basically a fictional biography of Orm which recounts his many violent military adventures.  In most cases Orm is the aggressor.  Although some conflicts do arise as revenge for previous battles, most are stand alone events and could have occurred in any random order.  Like most serialized TV series or movie serials from the 1950s, each adventure is pretty much unrelated to the others except that usually the same protagonists fight different enemies.  Of the 50 or so \"adventures\" at least half a dozen are accounts by third parties that Orm meets who tell the story of their own adventures.I say this to contrast the Long Ships to other sweeping novels that some other reviewers have compared it to, such as The Count of Monte Christo, or Les Miserables.  These novels also include many adventures but they all are integrated within a single overarching conflict which organizes the entire story and gives it compelling moral force. Since these novels merit 5 stars, I have to give the Long Ships only 4.5.2. Anachronistic: Often historical novels fascinate by helping us to wonder how people in the distant past thought the way they did.  How did the Greeks and Romans produce wonderful poetry yet practice slavery and ritual murder?  What attitudes do we have today that will be similarly scorned by future generations?  To be believable, it helps if the author attempts to convey the way these figures may have actually talked and thought.  But in the Long Ships the characters speak with a clarity of thought and introspection that modern men seldom attain even in written communication.  The contents of their thought and attitudes are foreign to us, but their style of communication seems much too modern to be believable.  It may be funny and charming to hear talk of raping and pillaging spoken like Victorian gentlemen at their tea, but more realism is usually necessary for the suspension of disbelief.  I suspect actual Vikings spoke and thought more like modern biker gang members.  But them the humor would disappear.3. Narrow Focus: I admire historical novelists (Patrick O'Brien comes to mind) who attempt to infuse all aspects of daily life into their stories.  Here the long ships comes up short.  There is plenty of (what we would today call) politics, sex, religion and violence.  But never a mention, for example, of how a long ship was built or who built them.4. Satire on Religion:  The story of the Long Ships occurs during the period when attempts were being made to convert the Vikings to Christianity.  Many do become Christians but their reasons for doing so are just as silly as the old pagan superstitions they had before.  Often they keep both sets of belief.  This thread of satire is woven throughout the novel to great comic affect.Enjoy.",

  "reviewText": "English literature began with a Viking story, \"Beowulf,\" but have you ever tried reading it? My own \"Beowulf\" experience led me to believe Viking literature is right down there with Viking cuisine in terms of digestibility. Imagine my surprise when I discovered a novel about Vikings, written over half a century ago, to be as thrilling, fantastic, and engaging as \"The Long Ships.\"It's the story of Orm, a farmer's son in southern Sweden in the late 900s who one day finds himself a prisoner of a merry gang of Vikings. They quickly adopt him, and set out for adventures off the northern and southern coasts of Europe. Before the book is half over, Orm has found himself in courts from Spain to England, espoused three different religions, slain several dozen foemen, and found a princess to be his bride.Frans G. Bengtsson's novel, originally published in Sweden in 1945, showcases two things I didn't expect from a Scandinavian academic, brevity and humor. Sure, the book is nearly 500 pages long, but Bengtsson crams a lot of incident in every page, describing events in broad strokes and letting the reader's imagination do the rest. Bengtsson's style, preserved marvelously by Michael Meyer's 1954 translation, is to consciously evoke the elliptical prose of ancient Viking sagas, but in such a way as to allow for a modern, tongue-in-cheek sensibility to come through, one that reflects a Viking world, however hard-bitten, of great wit and depth.\"The Long Ships\" is marvelously quotable: \"For no man complains of the weight of the cargo, when it is his own booty that is putting strain upon the oars.\" Or: \"Only poets can win wealth with empty hands, but then they must make better songs than other poets, and competition spoils the pleasure of composition.\"The book jacket includes an enthusiastic reviewer describing \"man-size helpings of battle and murder, robbery and rape,\" which captures some of the tone of \"Long Ships\" but misses most of the point. Orm is no savage bandit, but a thoughtful, evolving character of great honor. The Vikings he travels with do some robbing and killing, but in a measured way. As the novel goes on, a sense of social responsibility, manifested in Orm by his adoption of a somewhat twisted form of Christianity, comes through.You might say the story of Orm is the story of the Christianizing of Scandinavia, told from a rather neutral viewpoint that respects Christianity's mellowing influence without being blind to its flaws in practice. You might also call it a straight-up adventure yarn of many threads. After a battle, Orm and his comrades may retire to a feasting hall to hear stories of brave deeds that fill pages and then never come up again. Or else we might get stories like that of a pair of jesters, forced to entertain the slayer of the king they loved, who come up with a marvelous form of vengeance right out of Monty Python.One thing you can't call \"The Long Ships\" is dull. Even when Orm is not actually at sea (he actually spends a good deal of time raising a family on a farm), the book stays busy. Some old enemy is trying to take his head off, or else he is having another marvelously circuitous exchange with his dyspeptic priest friend, Father Willibald.And the voyages Orm takes are a lot of fun, encompassing as they do the whole of the known world at that time, from Ireland to the Dnieper River and many points in-between. While a work of fiction, Bengtsson finds ways of introducing a lot of relevant Dark Ages history, even if some of it, like an enjoyably arch Y1K scare, may not be 100% accurate.Other books are fun to read. \"The Long Ships\" is a book to get lost in. You will feel like a teenager again as you take the long way home with Orm, enjoying his simpler yet wondrous time and wishing the world could have stayed so forever.",

No point in repeating praise from others, so I just add that Frans Bengtson is a master in communicating the dry humor and matter-of-fact tone in authentic Olden Nordic style.Wish  more writers could learn from the frugal Norsemen! Like this 1000 year old saying:  \"Good Law is a poor shield against a poor Judge, but a good Judge can dispense good justice from bad Law\" (Domar Regler ca 1000 ad.) WOW, is that not good?Go and read Bengtsons unique story and walk through a door to a lost world the Viking tribes made a special place!PS: The title in Swedish is RODE ORM and translating the name of the hero to RED SNAKE just shows how darn difficult translating is! Obviously it is not a story about some \"communist creepy crawly\" at all. A more poetic translation of the Swedish title could be: \"Crimson Dragon\" or maybe \"Fierce Serpent\"? I would simply rename the next English publication \"The Saga of Red Orm\"",

This is among the best of such works I have read, ranking up there with the Homeric tales and the story of the Three Kingdoms from China. These Skanians (whom at that time considered themselves Danes, a far throw from the pacifist Europeans of modern Denmark) are savage men from a harsh culture, but they are also full of humor and a sort of stoic approach to both fortune and misfortune that despite their being seamen, would make a Spartan (from Laconia) proud. The story progresses through multiple kingdoms and conveys an accurate historical depiction of cultures at the cusp of the second millenium. Religion is dealt with in a tellingly humorous manner, and it reminds one that conversions were historically based on pragmatic choices and rarely some sort of spiritual epiphany. Adherents would switch from one religion to the next as their conditions (and fortunes) demanded. Buried into this amazingly rich (and incredibly fun!) tale of adventure like a vein of gold, it is a suitable reminder of what makes us human in this day of flaring religious strife and shameless demagoguery.",

I love good historical fiction, and The Long Ships is the best of the best. Intelligent humor and bold adventure in equal measures. I just finished it this morning, and I'm already thinking about the next time I'm going to read it. How many books can you say that about? I can't think of any in recent memory.

The author is an excellent story teller.  Even though it covers many years, many characters, and many adventures, it is told in such a way that you are able to take it all in at the right pace.  Sometimes it was slow and sometimes quick paced.  Sometimes the battle scenes are recounted and other times they are skipped over.  No one aspect is examined to an extreme degree.I enjoyed reading a novel that took place so long ago and painted a much different life in which we lead today.  When men were men (and it seems the Vikings were some of the most manly of all.)  They were violent, but had honor, reason, and their own sense of right and wrong.  Just as we do today.I really did not want this book to end and it lives in my mind as if it was real.",

  "reviewText": "This AMAZING book, written in the 1940s, translated into English in the 50's, available in English for only a year, then gone, and now re-surfaced mostly thanks to Kindle, is one of the most entertaining, fun, interesting, and subtly funny books I've read...ever.  It follows the life of Orm, a Viking who does all the usual Viking stuff - pillaging, exploring, fighting, searching for gold, etc. etc.  I'm not particularly interested in Viking history and lore, but this novel was simply gripping.The Long Ships is a book that operates on multiple levels.  For one thing, it's quite an interesting historical novel, with fictional main characters who interact with numerous real historical personages, providing an excellent feel for the time period, the key players, and Viking culture.  I now know about a thousand times more about who the Vikings were and how they lived and thought than I did before reading the book.  On another level, it's fantastic story-telling; in fact it's some of the best story-telling I've ever read.  You get lost in page after page of richly told stories of human conflict, honor, greed, lust, friendship, revenge, and redemption.  On another, and important level, it is a humorous tale, with wry and witty observations about the human condition - timeless observations about human nature that transcend the place and time of the novel.  Finally, on another level, it's a poetic saga, with beautifully-written, lyrical passages that get you flipping back a page or two to re-read what you just read, so as to re-savor the moment.  It is hard to believe that all of this could be accomplished in a single book, but there it is.The Vikings led lives of murder, pillage, rape, and mayhem, and it's all here in the book.  Yet, they also had morality - an understanding of right and wrong, a way of doing things that made sense to them and was grounded in spirituality - that is completely foreign to the modern mind but which sort of makes sense on its own alien terms.  A great strength of this book is its ability to place you inside the mindset of Viking morality so you can comprehend how it made sense to them, even if it seems (and was) horrific from a modern perspective.  As another reviewer noted, the book deals a lot with the Christianization of Scandinavia, circa 1000 AD, including the massive resistance of the Vikings to missionaries and the pressure to convert to Christianity.  This is dealt with in a very even-handed and balanced perspective; I doubt anyone could tell whether the author is particularly pro- or anti-Christian.  The zeal and tenacity of Christian missionaries to convert the heathens is presented both as pushy, naive, not purely altruistic, and destructive, but also as peace-seeking, beneficial, and redemptive.  All sides of the issue - the societal and spiritual benefits of pacification, but also the cultural cost of losing a familiar way of life as an alien moral order gradually takes hold - are explored in a thought-provoking, balanced way.Most of all, the characters are surprisingly human.  For a people who didn't even flinch at, and indeed actively sought out, extreme violence, people who would hope for a fight to the death at a wedding just to keep things lively, people whose lives were nasty, brutish and short as a result of their continual warfare and treachery, the Vikings are presented as intelligent, poetic, thoughtful people, people who if transported into today's world would be very recognizable to the modern reader, folks with hopes, dreams, and humanity.  It is very hard to reconcile the violence and mayhem of Viking culture with the humanity and likability of the characters, but somehow, improbably, it all fits together.  That is what makes this book so absolutely interesting and fun.The author has a wry sense of humor that comes through the pages over and over.  The subtle humor adds tremendously to the reading experience.Solid, flawless 5-star book on every level.",

Perhaps not about vikings, because The Long Ships (R&ouml;de orm)are so full of action, atmosphere, wisdom and wit that it would be folly to wish for more. Bengtsson has, however, written some hundred essays, only a few of which have been translated into English.

  "reviewText": "I think the best way to approach this book is not to think of it as a modern novel but instead imagine that you are being told this story by a grandfather or a bard in an inn on a stormy night.The Long Ships falls somewhere between epic poetry, an oral story, and a history of the Vikings; the book is not, however, a study of complex characters with deep psychologies and nuance. What you'll find here is a rip-roaring yarn about the various heroic adventures of Red Orm and his friends as they travel into Muslim lands and even as far away as modern-day Russia, and they'll fight and kill and marry and get religion and behave much more like regular people than what preconceptions about Vikings tend to describe.The only real complaint I have about many of these adventures (and the book in general) is that too often there is very little sense of danger for Orm - I never felt like anything really bad was going to happen to him and so even though the book is very well written (it moves at a great clip) there is no real tension moving the action forward. Basically we know Orm is going to be alright and so we just need to sit back and enjoy learning how he became alright. And that's not really a bad thing, but even Homer was able to place Odysseus is much tighter spots whose outcomes didn't always feel inevitable.Bengtsson's strength in the book is portraying the Vikings as real, living, breathing people and not just blood-thirsty killers bent on raping everything they see. Orm is a generous king, one who even converts to the strange and foreign (even undesirable) religion of Christianity. He treats his friends well, is fair to everyone fair to him, and is basically the ideal of a great warrior king - sort of like a Camelot but with more beards. I got the impression that Bengtsson wanted to celebrate his people's heritage by lending his characters all the good qualities other writers and historians have managed to overlook when dealing with these people. Of course this means the pendulum swings hard the other way and so this book can only be taken as entertainment with a heavy dose of ancestral pride.Yet it would be unfair for me to require Bengtsson to do anything more than what he has. He has written a story that is, above all else, fun to read and hard to put down. I mean, we're talking Vikings here and that's a subject nearly impossible to screw up. Is it uneven? Sure, but so what? I had fun with it.I would like to add that I find it really strange that this book is not more well known. This book deserves a much wider readership outside of its native country. Thankfully the New York Review of Books have created a wonderful edition (and they always do, too) and hopefully more people will discover this hidden treasure.",

  "reviewText": "Every serious reader has had the experience: perhaps by accident --on a library shelf, or in a dusty box at a garage sale-- you stumble across an out-of-print book that seizes your imagination through its author's sheer mastery of the storytelling craft.And you wonder: why, O why, doesn't the publisher re-issue this in lieu of one or another of the emminently forgettable titles in current release?Such a book is THE LONG SHIPS by Frans Bengtssen, which crossed the Atlantic from Scandinavia to America in the early 1950s; like Leif Ericson, who made the same trip long before Columbus, this book lingered only briefly here before vanishing with scarcely a trace.And that is a tragedy for anyone who craves an epic, lusty tale of Vikings and their travels-- told with a sophisticated humor that is both wry and understated and with a sense of historical perspective that blends so subtly into the narrative that one is staggered to later find it is painstakingly accurate. Thank you, History Channel-- but I heard it all first, and far more compellingly, from following Orm Tostesson's exciting voyages, enthusiastic plunderings and thrilling adventures in THE LONG SHIPS.This book is a delight in every way: certainly, you can read simply for it for the lyrical use of language (it is, by the way, a translation from its original Swedish, and translator Michael Meyer deserves canonization for his masterful rendering of it into English). But it works well on so many other levels --as an action/adventure, or as a character-driven historical novel-- that to attempt to limit this book's sophisticated multi-layered appeal would be a disservice.The copy I obtained (with great difficulty; it's hard to track down THE LONG SHIPS, but well worth the effort when you do) was published by Collins of St. James' Place, London. I understand Random House holds the American rights.If there is any justice in the literary world --or wisdom left in today's publishing houses that is not measured with a cash register--  THE LONG SHIPS would immediately be reissued to a new generation of readers, to much fanfare from those of us who have already had the pleasure of reading it.--Earl Merkel(Author, FLU SEASON/THE FINAL EPIDEMIC and LIKE DISTANT CITIES BURNING, NAL/Penguin/Putnam, both scheduled for publication in Summer/Fall 2002.)",

I'm not sure how accurate a portrayal of the times this book managed but I'm pretty sure there was much about it that caught the flavor of the time.  Fighting hard and thieving adventures with ominous dangers all served to remind, we weren't always washing our hands with anti-bacterial soap and recording three television shows while watching a fourth.  Mankind has a colorful past and this is a part of it I hadn't spent a lot of time thinking about but I enjoyed my immersion into the Viking world with all those men and all those kings.*The humor was sometimes subtle, sometimes not, but definitely there and woven effortlessly throughout.  I found myself giggling and snickering and snorting on occasion and smiling through much of this book.*I like a good action movie and I like adventure stories and there was definitely some good adventure in this book.But to me this book had some big problems.*It was episodic.  Not a bad thing per se if you're picking it up over a number of weeks, months, and reading it like a serial.  But I was reading this as a book group selection and had to keep trudging through it even when I would normally have put it down.  It just didn't hang together for me as a novel, more as a series of short stories.*The characters were simple, not too deep, and they fit with the stories but it was hard for me to care, too much, about any of them.  I have trouble when I can't invest in at least one of the characters.*Finally, and most importantly, it was too long.  I have two or three other books on my shelf and about a third of the way through this one I kept wishing I could put it down and read something else, something that would excite and interest me more deeply.For these reasons I can only give this book three stars and would only recommend it with caveats.",

  "reviewText": "The Long Ships is a book for those of us who as boys read Sir Walter Scott and Rudyard Kipling, the Rover Boys Series, Mark Twain and  Moby Dick as an adventure story and  also for everyone  of us of either sex and of whatever age who can now sit back and enjoy some great stories of Viking adventure threaded through and through with humor and not a little historical accuracy. While it's a serious book in that I was written by an author of talent, an essayist and poet in his own land (Sweden) and is therefore well written it's not a serious book to be taken seriously. It has no message and no moral. It doesn't try to solve any problems. It just tells some great stories.For the record The Long Ships is a collection of four novellas, centered on the life and adventures of Red Orm Tostesson, a late Eleventh Century (980-1025) Viking who lived in Skania in what was then a part of the kingdom of the Danes but which now lies on the southern tip of Sweden. The stories were first written and published in Swedish by Frans Bengsston, a Swedish essayist, translator and poet, in 1940-41 and then  translated and published in English in 1954, 15 years laterAll four of these novellas contain a heady stew of history, derring-do, adventure, love, fortune, friendship and - always - violence. In the first story where Red Orm, the son of Toste and his wife Asa, goes a-Viking in Krok's ship with his friend Toke, plunders the coasts of Normandy and Northern Spain, is captured by the Moors, spends six years as a galley slave, becomes a member of the Empower Alamansur's bodyguard, steals the world's most valuable necklace and then the largest bell from the Monastery of St James  (now Santiago de Campostella in Galicia) escapes and returns home safely there is enough material for a year's season of TV episodes.The same is true of the next three - in the first of which (he second of the novellas) Red Orm is a part of the Viking fleet which defeats the British (read Anglo-Saxons) at the battle of Maldon and eventually procured a true King's  ransom from weak King Ethelred.Then in the next story (the third novella) Red Orm and his family and retainers move to a safer place in the woods above their home in Skania to escape the wrath of King Sven Forkbeard (Orm has  married Ylva the beautiful youngest daughter of King Harald and sister of King Sven Forkbeard who is furious over the marriage). Here they have an almost endless series of adventures; and then, finally, in the fourth story Red Orm and his now grown sons and retainers together with his old friend Toke take a ship up the River Dvina, over \"The Great Portage\" to the Dneiper  and down the Dneiper past Kiev to \"The Weirs\" where they retrieve a great treasure and return safely home to live happily to the end of their days with fortune and family. (Best I can figure the route in present day terms is that they entered the Dvina at its mouth in the Gulf of Riga in Latvia, went up the Dvina to the source of the Deneiper in Russia and down the Dneiper to what is probably site of the huge Dnipropetrovsky Dam 200 miles up river from the Black Sea. Whatever it was it was quite a journey!)I recommend that the book be read slowly and for pleasure, not for knowledge - although there's a lot of history in it. . Take one novella at a time and enjoy it. I think Bengtsson wrote it for pleasure. An accomplished poet himself he larded it with the extemporaneous verses of his characters, although as translated from the Swedish, the poetry does not come through to the English reader. And he has a sense of humor. In every novella there are episodes which are simply over the top - funny - like the Flashman stories; they have all characteristics of Red Orm as Dick Armstrong the All-American Boy. In fact I think all these novellas are basically for men who are still boys at heart. Don't take this book too seriously.You will however - if you read it - come away with some real feeling for history in Red Orm's time. You will realize that there was no glamour in the Viking life. The Vikings were basically plunderers, setting out each spring in individual ships or  groups of one or two to go \"a-Viking\" along the coast of the North Atlantic countries. They were violent men. Swordplay and battle was the rule rather than the exception and the pages of this book run red with the blood spilled by the characters in these stories. If  you believe what Bengtsson writes they actually sought warfare and violence rather than peace.Furthermore if you read it  you will have a feel for the work of the several religious orders that sent Priests to the Vikings in an effort to Christianize them and the effect on Red Orm of his baptism in Book Three. You will have a feel for the limited extent to which \"civilization\" as the Western World then knew it had changed the way of life of the many small tribes which inhabited the region of the Danes and how far they had to come to catch up.I enjoyed it and hope you do too.",

I like all sorts of adventure books and this one ranks right up with the best and is so satisfying because it seems like a hidden, mostly undiscovered gem. I've read Bernard Cornwell's Viking books and liked them and I watch the show Vikings on The History Channel and I can safely say that The Long Ships is better and seems to have been the inspiration if not a direct source for those newer works.

  "reviewText": "I recommend Bengtsson's The Long ShipsA good friend loaned me a copy of Frans Bengtsson's The Long Ships, telling me that I would be unable to put it down. He was right. This novel has everything anyone might wish for--a heroic protagonist, a (slightly) alien tribal culture, and a close look at the world of 950-1000 through the lens of that culture.When I say \"the world\" it means far more than I was aware of. The Vikings of that time had actual contact with almost everywhere: the Middle East, Scandinavia, Spain, large areas of England and Ireland, even, at second-hand, China. The protagonist, Red Orm, actually worked, with other Vikings, as part of the bodyguard, of a Muslim Emperor.  Check out the maps at the front of the book.The Viking culture was based on tribal and regional loyalties. There was a surprising emphasis on wealth, but even more surprising was the code of behavior. In that code, men fought to the death over insults, over treasures, over women. If that doesn't surprise anyone--these things seem rooted in human nature--what may surprise you is the great pleasure they took in being drawn to a fight. A fight was a joyous occasion.  The lack of fear or grief at death was a given.There was also farming going on, and hunting for fur-bearing animals. The climate seems to echo that of northern Maine, so the difficulties of the farmer will be pretty evident to Mainers.This time period was also when Christianity began to press forward in the Scandinavian areas, supplanting the wide variety of gods which had served the social needs of the Vikings. It was certainly not easy for the priests and monks. Many were enslaved and sold or killed outright. Over time, we see the gradual shift in values which suggests the ultimate dominance of Christianity. But, like all cultural shifts, it was not without its difficulties--fascinating to observe.Ok--what about the story? That's where this book takes off and won't stop. We follow the career of Red Orm, through the twists and turns of life as it was lived in those days. It's riveting. It's told in short sections, as if you were in the presence of a gifted story-teller--the chapter-titles alone will give you that sense: \"Concerning Thane Toste and his household,\" \"Concerning Krok's expedition, and how Orm set forth on his first voyage,\" and so on.The author wrote this book in Swedish. The translator was phenomenally gifted; he gives the reader the sense of a different time, and a different culture, but without being distracting. You'll be interested in Michael Chabon's introduction, also. He's as much an enthusiast as I am, and has read The Long Ships a number of times. Among other things, he says, \"Like half the great European novels, The Long Ships is big, bloody, and far-ranging, concerned with war and treasure, and the grand deeds of men and kings; like the other half, it is intimate and domestic, centered firmly around the seasons and pursuits of village and farm, around weddings and births, around the hearths of women who see only too keenly through the grand pretensions of men and bloody kings.\" I liked the book so much I bought a copy, and persuaded our librarian to accept it as part5 of the library collection.Have fun!",

  "reviewText": "From my perspective, the mark of a really good book is fear that it will soon end.  That was my feeling when reading, \"The Long Ships\".  While I long for a successor work, there will be none from the now-deceased Frans G. Bengtsson, whose outstanding tale of the Vikings with its epic hero in epic adventures is, quite simply, one of the best examples in the long-standing tradition, one which extends from Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", through \"Beowulf\" and \"The Nibelungenlied\" to mention only a very few of the very finest.  Red Orm is now resting in Valhalla just as Odysseus lies in the Elysian fields and Siegfried's \"strength had ebbed away, for in the field of his bright countenance he now displayed Death's token.  Soon many fair ladies would be weeping for him.\"Bengtsson's hero \"goes a-Viking\", initially as a captive of the marauding Krok on his long ship and later on his own adventures. He sails as an oar-slave for the Moors; roves ashore in the guard of the Moorish potentate Almansur in Cordoba; returns homeward in a captured ship; returns home where he establishes himself as a sober-minded chieftain; humorously and pragmatically engages with and accepts Christianity; quests for Bulgarian treasure; battles with sword and club and finds domestic contentment at voyages' end.The writing style is heroic, but not overwrought.  Here is an example with Orm talking to his companion, Toke: \"I know what I am leaving behind but the wisest of men could not tell me to what I am returning or whether things will turn out as I fear they may.\"  Another example, \"But sometimes he was visited by evil dreams, and then he would become so agitated in his sleep that Ylva would wake him to ask whether the night mare was riding him, or whether there was any trouble on his mind.  When he had awakened and had fortified his courage with strong ale, she would hear, perhaps, that in his sleep he had returned to the Moorish galley and had been rowing his heart out as the whip snaked across his shoulders and the groans of his fellows filed his ears and their wealed backs bent painfully before his eyes; and on the morning after such a dream he loved to sit beside Rapp, who never dreamed, in the carpenter's shed and exchanged memories with him of those far-off days.\"  What could be more perfectly evocative?  The playful and pragmatic engagement of the \"heathen\" Vikings with their gods and the Christian god was also brilliantly rendered.  For example, Orm remarks, \"Whether any of our gods have done anything for me, though, I do not know, certain it is that I have not done much for them.\"If there are any authors who are currently writing with the verve and epic sweep of \"The Long Ships\" I am unaware of them.  If there are any other modern adventure tales that can stand equal with \"The Long Ships\" I know nothing of them, either.  This is, I say without hesitation, an immortal masterpiece.  NYRB deserves immense credit for resurrecting it.  If you are searching for another book that embodies the same virtues, I unhesitatingly recommend (if you can find it),  the wonderful textual rendering of ancient poem, \"The Nibelungenlied\" by A.T. Hutto, found in an early (1965) Penguin edition.",

  "reviewText": "THE LONG SHIPS is old-school narrative with a very traditional feel, as Frans G. Bengtsson weaves historical fiction from a Viking point-of-view.  There's a sweep to it, yes, as it follows the life of Orm Tostesson from his youth to older age.  Episodic, it is also interrupted in the classical way as brief stories are told by new characters who happen into the narrative.To start, Orm goes to Muslim Spain where he is captured by the Moors and forced to convert.  He becomes the bodyguard of a wealthy Muslim caliph.  After a series of adventures there, the action shifts north to Ireland and then England under the inept King Ethelred.  Yes, you will learn some history reading this book, as Bengtsson allows Red Orm to interact with real characters throughout.  Part Three of the book takes us to Orm's homeland and concerns marriage, conversion to Christianity, and children.  Of course, to keep readers interested, violence remains a way of life, even here.  And in the final section, Orm seeks a treasure in the lands past Kiev.  This part was too brief and seemed to have more possibility to it.Nevertheless, there's no denying the bond that will form between reader and Orm.  Although it might be called a man's book, it holds strong female characters, too, especially Orm's wife Ylva, daughter of Harald Blue-Tooth.  And through it all is a sense of humor.  Can you do worse than that, between all the looting and bloodletting?  I thought not.  If you're looking for a book of the sort you read as a kid -- the kind you just ate up due to its \"story\" -- this is a distinct possibility.  Adventure and history make wonderful bedfellows, and nothing proves it as much as THE LONG SHIPS.",

It goes from Scandinavia to Moorish Spain and the situation between Christians and Moors, the viking raids on England at the time of Ethelred the Redeless, viking life and the revolt of Swen Forkbeard against his father, Harald Bluetooth and the attitude regarding the Christianizing of the north and, finally, the road to Miklegaard (Byzantium) and the situation there.  It was a disappointment only in its brevity.  It is a book that I have read time and time again, finding the rich language and colorful descriptions and great chacterizations.Highly recommended.",

  "reviewText": "I've read this novel many years ago and left within me a certain fascination for the Viking Era.Lastly books like Harry Harrison's \"The Hammer & the Cross\" trilogy, movies like \"Grendel & Beowulf\" (2005) and \"Beowulf\" (2007) had triggered again my curiosity about these times. So I decided to \"pay a visit\" (aka re-read) \"The Long Ships\".And here I am reviewing this excellent book authored by Sweden writer Frans G. Bengtsson (1894-1954). The book was originally published in two parts first in 1941 and second in 1945; the present edition contains both of them.The story follows the life & circumstances of Orm from infancy to old age at the same time describing daily life of that period.Orm as teenager is abducted by a Viking war-party and joins them willingly after a short period. From their homeland they sail to Spain where they are captured by Moors and enter Almansur's service.After serving some years as Caliph's bodyguards they are forced to fly and return home, yet not empty-handed.They are welcome at Denmark King Harald's Bluetooth court where Orm fall in love with Ylva one of the King daughters and ask her hand. The King is quite accessible but asks Orm to ensure his wealth and return next year.Orm & his friends join a mighty Viking army and sail to invade King Ethelred's the Unprepared England. After many battles and errands Orm rejoin exiled Ylva & marry her, returning then to his home.Orm and his family are forced into exile to escape King Sven Forkbeard revengeful mood and finally root in his mother's ancestral domains.After years of consolidating his position as a respected member of that frontier community, Orm sail for his last great adventure in Eastern lands.This is a very entertaining book merging seamlessly historical characters as King Harald, Sven, Ethelred and Caliph Almansur with fictional ones as Orm, Ylva, Asa and Toste. The author is able to transmit to the reader the true spirit of those turbulent times. Another very interesting aspect of the story is showing the beginning of Christianization of Scandinavian communities.Take a joyful romp thru Viking's world, you won't be disappointed!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",

  "reviewText": "This had been recommended to me several times, particularly by others who read and enjoyed Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Tales, which take place at exactly the time as The Long Ships, and actually include some of the historical characters.I tried to ration this novel out, savoring every chapter, watching with dread as the number of pages to the end dwindled... Alas, I couldn't make it last forever... it's one of those books that left me a bit sad at the end, for I'll never again have the thrill of reading it for the first time.It's a story about Vikings: one Viking in particular, who gallivants around 10th century Europe doing all of those things that the Vikings were famous for doing. Orm Tosteson's world is a surprisingly cosmopolitan one: he travels from his home in Sweden to the Mediterranean, befriending a Jewish merchant and entering the service of the Muslim Caliph of Andalusia... returns home with stops in France and the British Isles... and ventures, later in his life, up and down rivers in Central Europe as far as the Black Sea. His travels and associates allow him to experience and weigh the relative merits of several different religious traditions... these Vikings really got around.Michael Chabon's effusive introduction to the edition I read was spot-on: yes, it's basically a Viking adventure story, but \"offers... something for everyone.\" Although initially skeptical of the praise heaped upon the book, I now find myself agreeing with Chabon that the novel \"stands ready, given the chance, to bring lasting pleasure to every single human being on the face of the earth.\"It's beautifully written, or at least beautifully translated from the Swedish, imparting a love of language and a loyalty to the ancient epics.I was totally unprepared for, and very pleasantly surprised by, how funny certain parts of the book were. The first few pages deal with the fate of Christian missionaries in the lands of the Northmen, and are absolutely hysterical. Bengtsson's sardonic humor blends perfectly with the brutality of the age he's writing about.In short, I can't recommend this book highly enough. If you enjoy reading fiction at all, you'll enjoy it. Again, I'll steal from Chabon's introduction: I \"loved it immoderately\".",

  "reviewText": "The Long Ships, by Frans G. Bengtsson, is an historical novel set in various parts of Europe in the decades around 1000 A.D. It's hero is a viking by the name of Red Orm and it is written in the style of the Icelandic sagas. The text is matter of fact in tone, tending toward understatement rather than melodrama. Descriptive passages are brief and never bog down the story. It is filled with a wry humor that often had me laughing out loud. It's a true delight to read, which is amazing to me as this story was written in Swedish - almost 60 years ago! - and has been translated into English and yet it is extremely easy to read. Easier than some books I've read by English writers of more recent times. Still, I think a word of warning might be in order for those unread in the sagas: there's no great emphasis on introspection here. No one really agonizes as they vacillate for chapters over every decision a la Shakespeare's Hamlet. This isn't a psychological drama, which suits me just fine. What it is is a great viking adventure.It was originally written as two novels of two parts each and it shows here and there, most notably in the final part. The four unequal parts are 1) The Long Voyage (167 pages), 2) In King Ethelred's Kingdom (63 pages), 3) In the Border Country (134 pages), and 4) The Bulgar Gold (120 pages). The entire novel is very good, but I must confess to liking the earlier parts better than the later ones. The Long Voyage covers the period from just before Red Orm's abduction by fellow vikings, through his enslavement and eventual escape from the Moors, and his return home as a proud and accomplished viking. In Ethelred's Kingdom reveals how Orm raids England and gets married and shows us just how much this changes his circumstances. In the Border Country is where Orm settles down and sets about raising his family far from a very angry king. The Bulgar Gold is a final adventure for our domesticated viking. This time he heads east and finds setting forth as an older, more established viking feels entirely different than adventuring as a poor but vigorous youth. The beginning of part four is the roughest part of the whole book for me, but it ends wonderfully.Religion plays a prominent role in the story. The vikings are starting to convert to Christianity, which is not as established as it is today. Priests wheel and deal as they barter for as many souls as they can save. Orm starts out a heathen, then is forced to become Muslim, and finally chooses to be Christian in order to wed his lady love. Though he accepts Christianity and becomes a good ambassador for the faith, he's by no means a fanatic. He accepts it for what he gets out of it. I find his attitude to be very practical. Every faith is depicted in a good light, despite the more prominent place Christianity stakes within the tale.The viking world comes alive in this book and we get to see viking society in action. We're shown how their relationships are built and broken and sometimes restored. We tag along as great booty is made off with time and again, whether that booty is a humongous religious artifact, a forbidden woman, or great heaps of gold and silver. Reading the Long Ships let me experience how it might feel to be a northman a thousand years ago.More importantly, it entertains me immensely. It is fun.",

Bengtsson captures the spirit of these wild raiders but also adds a very rich view of the humanity, humor and nobility that was also part of the Viking culture.The book is a saga, not a novel, and the structure rambles and links many stories, legends and religious customs, but it holds together very well as a whole.  The story centers on the life of Orm, who has many splendid and varied adventures, all of which are consistent with what historically could have happened in this time and place.  The story hold together almost as if it was a novel, because we see the growth of Orm as a fully developed character.The Long Ships, is a great read and loaded with insight into the Viking culture not found in Cornwall's Saxon series.  It also has a humanity and sense of humor not found in the recent T.V. series on the History Channel's, Vikings.",

  "reviewText": "This novel, originally published in the 1940's as two books, tells the story of Orm Tostesson, a Dane who did what many Scandinavian men did in the 10th century -- he went a-Viking.  Orm's voyages take him to Andalusia (Spain), Britain, and Russia.  He makes friends and enemies, has wins and losses, and while I've never been a fan of pillaging, I had to admire him.Bengtsson's writing style might seem odd (even staid) to modern readers.  There are no &#34;literary&#34; embellishments -- Bengtsson simply tells Orm's story -- explicitly.  It's all on the page.  There will be passages that make the reader pause and ponder, not to decipher meaning but to consider the differences between present day and the 10th century.Religion -- Christianity and Islam -- has a large role in the book.  In one of my favorite passages, a character wonders why a king has converted to Christianity.  He determines that &#34;...kings drink stronger ale than other man, and have many women, and that can tire a man over the years, so that his understanding darkens and he no longer knows what he is doing.&#34;I wasn't bored for a minute.  The book is loaded with everything that makes a good adventure story, and even when Orm is living quietly at home, there's plenty going on.  I totally agree with Chabon, who says in the introduction that this book &#34;stands ready . . . to bring lasting pleasure to every single human being on the face of the earth.&#34;",

  "reviewText": "A number of years ago I stumbled upon a non-fiction history of the Norman invasion of England in 1066, and immediately decided that I wanted to read everything I could about this historical period, especially works of fiction, which I love.  Well, there was Mirsky's King of Vinland Saga, which was good but needed more depth;  there was King Hereafter by Dorothy Dunnett, which was, as usual for her, too dense;  there was the out-of-print Golden Warrior, by Hope Muntz, which was excellent, but perhaps required a bit too much work.  I finally read several hundred pages worth of the Sagas of the Icelanders, but as interesting as these were, they bear little resemblance to the modern novel.  Recently, I came upon the Long Ships and here, finally, it is.  This great book ranks up there with the best historical fiction of any genre and is certainly the best I have come across as it regards the ancient Vikings.First, it is page-turning, exciting adventure.  Little battles, big battles, individual confrontations, blood feuds, revenge, camaraderie, treasure, despair, hate and love;  it's all here.  The book pretty much follows the career, as it were, of Orm, who is initially kidnapped by the crew of a Viking ship and who agrees to accompany them on their ambitious, faraway raid to a wealthy fortress on the Iberian peninsula.  Orm didn't particularly mind being kidnapped too much, as raiding for plunder was pretty much the goal of every Northman over the age of about twelve anyway.  (Interestingly, the word \"Viking\" here is used as a verb.  To go on a raiding party is to go \"a-viking.\")Their raid is a success, to begin with, but they are in turn are attacked by a fleet of Moorish vessels out for revenge.  Those that survive are captured and become galley slaves for almost three years.  Through luck and circumstance, they are freed, and made bodyguards to the powerful Almansur, the Muslim lord.  Eventually they escape and make their way back to their homes in the North, but not before fighting several other battles and experiencing many other adventures.  We're only about half way through at this point, and there is much, much more to come.Along with Orm's adventures the novel is interspersed with the stories of just about everybody they run into.  The Vikings loved stories and poems and there are many different tales told by many different personalities, many of which are of some length, and all of which are bloody and riveting.So there is adventure a-plenty here but the novel is also very well-written, filled with wit, irony and humor.  Orm is grievously wounded after a bloody battle to the death and is tended to by King Harald's daughter.  (The Vikings had a pretty sophisticated system of justice, but, alas, when all else fails, it's a kill or be killed.)  In any event, she tells Orm that she was betrothed to the person that he killed.  Orm is, naturally, worried that she will seek her revenge on him.  She tells him that she hated the man that Orm killed, and would have murdered him in his sleep.  Eventually, Orm begins to take to her, and starts to woo her:  \"You told me that if you had been forced to marry Sigtrygg you would have driven a knife into him in his bridal bed,\" he says to her, after suggesting that he wanted to marry her, \"and I should like to be sure that you feel differently towards me.\"  She laughs, \"merrily.\"  The book is filled with clever wordplay such as this on just about every page, and you will find a smile coming to your face often.Some reviews here have expressed doubt that these illiterate Vikings would be so articulate, but I'm not so sure.  No, they were not educated to any extent, but it must be remembered that there were few forms of entertainment in those days other than story-telling and word-of-mouth, so it is quite likely that to entertain or to be entertained, one may very well have had to cultivate linguistic skills.Lastly, the novel is rich in historical detail, especially that having to do with the mindset of those that lived back then.  The Vikings were somewhat religious, but not terribly so, and were far more interested in doing whatever it was that would bring them \"luck.\"  Indeed, they become Muslims while in Spain at the insistence of their Muslim superiors.  \"Our Gods don't seem to be too powerful here,\" one remarks.  Eventually, Orm is persuaded to become a Christian, not because of a new found love for Jesus, but primarily due to convenience.  There is a great deal of discussion of Christianity in the novel, the way it was practiced, and the pragmatic, unconventional ways by which the priests tried to gain converts.  It is quite interesting and has the ring of truth to it.There is also the Viking way of life, their customs and their culture.  Farming, mostly;  some trading.  They loved women and they loved boozing.  As much as anything, though, it was raiding and fighting and maintaining one's honor.  A brutal way of life, to be sure, but that was the way in northern Europe.  And there are many descriptions of foreign climes as well:  northern Europe to be sure, but also England, Ireland, Spain, central Europe, and Russia.  It is, simply, fascinating.Great novel.  Ranks up there with the best historical fiction.",

Our hero, Orm, and his band of merry bad asses go &#34;a Viking&#34; and get into all kinds of interesting and thouroughly enjoyabe scrapes en route.  The plot has a nice way of seeding characters and events that reappear later in the story.  The book is plot driven but the main character is nicely drawn and the tone is deadpan humor no matter the event.It was written in 1956 so I was afraid it would be dated but no, its fresh and crisp totally au fait with our zeitgeist.  Having read far too many of Bernard Cornwell's Saxon saga's this was  truly refreshing.  Unlike the recent crop of Cornwellia, the author knows exactly where he's going and doesn't tarry taking you there.  The translation is excellent, I guess - my old Norse is a trifle rusty; it certainly scans well.Highly reccomended.For those of you who like this genre, you might want to check out &#34;Eagle In the Snow&#34; by Wallace Breem.  Another forgotten classic, it tells the story of Maximus who guards the Rhine against people like Orm.  He is woefully outnumbered by the Northmen and the struggle is epic.

It paints a gloriously human picture of life, love, war, politics, family, and adventure in the Viking era. I would call it a great book especially for anyone who is interested in old Norse, Danish, and Scandinavian history but who shies away from stories that are entirely focused on bloodshed.  Which is not to say that the Long Ships is bloodless - far from it! - but it leavens its (pretty awesome) fighting sequences with character development, humor, and romance.  The narrative voice is widely tolerant and amused, so the reader can follow Orm from Denmark to Spain, Ireland, England, and the Ukraine; from Paganism to Islam and Christianity; and from rash feckless youth through adventuresome coming of age to settled family life and chieftanship with unremitting enjoyment.  It's particularly nice to note that a book written 100 years ago will not distress modern readers with its depiction of Jewish and Muslim characters or its treatment of women.Highly recommended any reader interested in adventure, comedy, romance, Vikings, history, politics, economics, the Medieval era, geography, sailing, family life, religion, or just looking for a REALLY good story.",

  "reviewText": "\"The Long Ships\" is a true classic novel, as much as that term is overused.  This splendid novel combines deadly adventure, humor, and an insightful look at the Viking age and society into a story that is a true page-turner.  This is the story of Orm, a Danish Viking of noble blood, who leads a life that is more fruitful and adventurous than most.  Orm begins life as an over-protected younger son, who is abducted by Vikings and who then speaks up for himself and eventually becomes a Viking chieftain by virtue of his intelligence, leadership, and strength.  This novel really gets inside of Scandinavian society at the height of the Viking Age and truly acquaints the reader with the way people thought about life and things in those days.  There are more wonderful anecdotes in this novel than I can count or remember.  This novel is a rare reading pleasure.The Viking Age was a terrible age of rich living and hard dying.  The Vikings themselves were a scourge against the peoples of Europe and beyond, and yet, as this novel shows, they were people too, with all the motivations that people have always had, in every age.  This novel truly brings this age to life and the reader will come to greatly care about Orm and his wife Ylva, who is the daughter of a King.  This story is not all about war and battle.  The sub-story about the Christian Magister, and his love of women, is one of the funniest things I have ever read.  It is a rare novel that can combine adventure and humor the way this one does.Incidentally, while this novel was the inspiration for the Richard Widmark/Sidney Portier movie \"The Long Ships,\" the storyline itself has about nothing in common with that fun movie.  At most some of the names are the same.I could go on and on about what a fine story this novel is, but I am sure that by now you get the idea.

The funny thing is that now that I have it, it is immediately obvious that while Chabon covers a fair bit of ground in his intro. one thing that he doesn't know is that Red Orm is alive and well, and familar to any six year old german boy (e.g. my two sons), in Vickie und die st&auml;rken M&auml;nner (''''''''''''), an old japanse-german animated TV series that tells the adventures of the clever red-haired Viking boy Vikkie, his girlfriend Ylvi (his mother is Ylva) and his enemy Der Schreckliche Sven, and which has been repeating forever on german TV.  It's pretty obvious, as soon as you pick up the book, and then  you run into Ylvi (and the Swedish entry for Vicke Vicking, the original book, on Wikipedia confirms it). This only makes The Long Ships even more fun to read, and is precisely the sort of configuration that MIchael Chabon of all people would appreciate.Adventures, ships, galley slaves, friends and roasted lamb round beach campfires, pretty girls, fights, axes, toledo swords, more adventures, more fights, and, of course, baddies that cry out to be played by Alan Rickman in the movie.  In short, a very superior ripping yarn for literate small boys of all ages (and sexes).  You can imagine Orm, late in life on his estate, settling down to a copy of Beowulf, ale-cup beside him, and not being terribly impressed.",

  "reviewText": "this book was originally published in 1957, before political correctness required that truth and accuracy be supressed in favor of sensitivity.  the author, Frans Bengtsson, was a history professor who had done his research, and then spun an epic tale of Norsemen behaving badly.  The entire western european coast was open to plunder, and one long ship with 60 men could devastate a village of thousands.  Of particular interest were the tales of Orm's capture and enslavement by the Muslim Moors in Spain. Who knew that the Muslim Calefs preferred to staff their personal guards with Norsemen, because they felt these men were more loyal, honest, and trustworthy than their own soldiers.  Orm's adventures, failures, cleverness, and fighting spirit were a composite of many Viking legends, and blended together nicely.  It was a testiment to the author that he could create a likable and sympathetic character in Orm, who fell in love, married, and raised two daughters in a warm and loving home, in between raiding coastal towns and killing innocent villagers trying to protest their wives and daughters from Orm and his bloodthirsty beserkers. It is a long read (originally done in 4 seperate books), but truly a classic for anyone interested in Viking history.Note: I understand that there will be a new printing in 2010, which is good news for all who have heard of this epic and would like to read it.  Currently, because of its rarity, some booksellers are demanding upwards of $100 for an old copy.",

  "reviewText": "Having heard so much about this saga-type novel I sought it eagerly & finally broke down & bought it via amazon uk (after a long & fruitless hunt stateside).  Rather expensive for this paperback w/lots of  typos & editing problems, I thought. But the book, I judge, was worth  it in the end. The tale of Orm Tostesson & \"friends\", this  book follows the adventures of this typical late tenth century viking  through nearly all the high-points of vikingdom in the period. From raids  & servitude on the coasts of Moorish Spain, to visits with Irish monks  and dinner with the Danish King, Harald Bluetooth, and his assorted guests,  including no less a worthy than Styrbiorn Olafsson, the Jomsviking and  claimant to the Swedish throne about whom E. R. Eddison wrote so  brilliantly in his own viking novel,Styrbiorn the Strong, this book takes  us through all the paces. Orm ends up with a very noble wife living in a  backwater part of Scandinavia (the borderlands between Sweden and medieval Denmark) but even there he gets no peace since his enemies and adventures pursue him. And in his maturity another and final adventure comes his way when he is summoned to the eastern reaches of  far Gaardarike (the country  that was to become Russia) to claim an  \"inheritance\" of great  value. Along the way, Orm makes some good friends, some bad enemies,  participates in some (but by no means all) of the great events of viking history in that period, and finally mellows to become a better man who embraces the new way of thinking while yet feeling at home in the old.I  did think the book a bit too episodic though this is no indictment of it since the sagas themselves are nearly always such and the \"voice\"  smacks very much of the sagaman's art. However, a close reading makes this very clearly a modern novel for the humor is quite bracing and alone marks this tale out as one of ours and not one from an earlier time. I especially  appreciated Orm's hypochondria, despite his courage in the face of battle, a very human and humorous touch! And the fighting is all very realistic, no great superhuman  feats of derring do (except occasionally as we find in the real sagas). Some of the literary technniques used, besides the  marvelous sense of tongue-in-cheek humor, are also quite contemporary. I  did think the tale a bit slow in places, especially at the beginning, and rather more predictable than not.And, more, it is not, in my opinion the  best of the viking or saga novels despite what others have said here. For  tautness and action, none have yet done it better, in my  opinion, than H.  Rider Haggard with Eric Brighteyes. For the pure poetry of style, Eddison's  STYRBIORN THE STRONG still has my vote. And for the resounding greatness of  the tale and the power to move, no modern author has ever penned a better  saga novel than Hope Muntz did withThe Golden Warrior. But Bengtsson did a  very nice job and deserves five stars for it. I take my hat off to him and to those here whose reviews obliged me to obtain and read this fine viking  tale.(For those with an interest in the saga as novel, a few other good  ones I'd recommend include Cecelia Holland's very modern and psychologicalTwo Ravens, a glimpse into the hot-house environment of  an Icelandic farm,  and Jane Smiley'sThe Greenlanderswhich tells of the final days of the the Norse settlement in Greenland as the cold and the Eskimos closed in around  the settlers there. And if you still have any patience and want more, perhaps  you'd want to try my own small effort, THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA, which I  wrote to be the saga I'd always wished had been written and preserved about  the Norse excursions to this part of the world. All, I believe, are  available in some form or another on-line. Mine I know is.)Stuart W.  MirskyAuthor ofThe King of Vinland's Saga",

They generate neither sympathy nor joy and they are stuck in a storytelling style which is framed in the act of \"recounting\" a multi-year adventure where the same things keep happening: The Vikings go ashore in strange places to pillage.  They then high-tail it on the sea before they are caught. Sometimes they escape, sometimes they are captured and enslaved.  Rinse, repeat.Drama, complications, character development: Nonexistent.  Humor: Rare, regardless of what the other reviews promise.  Nevertheless, it's the non-dynamic style which truly kills it.I usually give up on boring books if they don't become very promising by the 25% mark.  I stuck with this one until I'd finished 30% because it was unusual and intermittently interesting at the beginning.

  "reviewText": "Bengtsson has done a spectacular job of bringing the days of Viking to life. In the past, I've enjoyed reading translations of many sagas from around the era this describes. There's nothing like an original source, of course, even in translation. But, for a fictional tale, I found this a lively and clever invention. It makes the most of the cultural shifts under way as Christianity made its first, uncertain inroads into the north, but also takes advantage of the Vikings' wide travels downward toward Moorish Iberia and inland toward modern Russia. These offer wide scope for adventure, swashbuckling, humor, wild coincidence, and a bit of understated warrior philosophy.And, throughout, Bengtsson throws in asides that had me rolling. For example, one recent convert to Christianity had also been under Muslim command in previous years, including religious observances. So, when he crossed wires and announced &#34;There is no god but God, and Christ is His prophet,&#34; it seemed a natural (if humorous) enough slip - not that the priests took it in that spirit.I can't comment on the original, but I found this translation easy to enjoy. It comes across as natural and reasonably modern, but without losing the thousand-year-old flavor of they story's setting, and certainly without losing any of the incredible factual research that went underlies the fiction. This book was recommended to my by someone with an uncommon knack for picking books as gifts, and proves that she hasn't lost her touch. I was sorry to see the last page arrive.-- wiredweird",

It's a sweeping, swaggering story that spans kingdoms as Orm the Red goes a-viking and gets enslaved by Moors, ensnared in palace intrigues, falls in love and undergoes a dangerous religious conversion.  Not only is it tremendously entertaining, but it gives you an incredibly rich feel for the texture of life in the Viking period, from the British Isles to the Mediterranean, from imperial capitals to remote farms on the frontiers of Scandinavia.  Can't wait to read it again.",

Brilliant character development, superb technical detail.HMS Ulysses is  a good novel -- more than that, the book pays tribute to both the Royal  Navy and the Merchant Marine, and homage in equal measure to all -- German,  British, American.  It reminds us that brave men sailed the North Atlantic,  and that courage knows no boundaries.The book follows the fortunes of a  fighting ship whose crew is slowly self-destructing after months of convoy  duty in the North Atlantic.  They are offered the prospect of a break in  the Mediterranean if they can complete one final convoy to Russia through  the murderous North Atlantic, and thereby atone for a mutiny that has left  two people dead...Their voyage -- and ultimate atonement -- tests the  mettle of all on board, and challenges the base assumptions we tend to make  about the inherant goodness of Humanity.  It will leave you pondering how  you would have responded under similar circumstances, and perhaps may leave  you less than satisfied with what you learn about yourself.As a tale it  compares well with Noel Coward's wartime movie &quot;In Which We  Serve&quot;.  MacLean paints his tale with prosaic pictures that stay in  your mind more persistently than any film could.  The final image of the  HMS Ulysses, with battle ensign flying, stays with you long after you put  the book down.MacLean's book reminds us that things like this happened  every day, once.  It is a reminder of the gallantry of a generation that is  fast disappearing.",

  "reviewText": "\"H.M.S. Ulysses\" was famed author Alistair Maclean's very first novel, a raw, emotional, and thinly-disguised account of a British warship on the Murmansk Convoys of World War II.  The convoys carried war material to the Soviet port of Murmansk in the high Arctic under the guns of Nazi planes and ship operating out of occupied Norway.  Between the frigid weather and the Nazis, convoy losses were extremely high.The warship of the title suffers the disgrace of a mutiny aboard ship after too many days and nights on the convoys.  The British Admiralty, short on escorts, sends the ship and crew straight out again on a voyage of redemption.Maclean's service in the Royal Navy during World War II included time on the Murmansk convoys; he populates the crew of H.M.S. Ulysses with the kind of battle-weary men he served with, and their portraits ring true.  These were men with no illusions about themselves or their chances for survival, and no loyalties save to the ship and their shipmates.  Among the most memorable is Captain Vallery, the Commander, a duty-driven, almost saintly man, slowly dying of tuberculois but unwilling to abandon his crew.  His sacrifice is only one of many portrayed by Maclean; an ordinary seaman's refusal to leave his post under fire, even to save his own life, is made believable and memorable.H.M.S. Ulysses and its crew will strive to the very end; few readers will be unmoved by the penultimate scene of the book.  This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean and to others looking for a first-rate reading experience.",

He gained fame through books such as \"Ice Station Zebra,\" \"The Guns of Navarone,\" and \"Where Eagles Dare,\" but some of his later books seemed to devolve into predictable affairs.\"HMS Ulysses\" still stands as a remarkable first novel and as a classic of war on the sea.

Belfast, now part of the Imperial War Museum, moored in the Pool of London on the River Thames just inside the Tower Bridge.  (See [...] for more detail.)  It was a self-guided tour.  With pamphlet in hand the curious tourist can poke through practically every passageway in the ship.  Lifelike mannequins represent life on board one of Her Majesty's proudest vessels.  Even the ship's cat is represented keeping guard over undesirable stowaways.  The mighty turrets seem invincible.  The crew's quarters seem cramped, but the atmosphere is adventurous and almost romantic.  The ship seems large and powerful and puissant.In between trips, I picked up an old copy of H.M.S. Ulysses, by spellbinding mystery and adventure author Alistair Maclean.  Through the eyes of the crew of the Ulysses I experienced real life aboard the Belfast.  The Ulysses, though not exactly the same ship as the Belfast, nevertheless shared many commonalities with her.  They were both used as escorts for the savage arctic convoys, brutally trying to bring supplies and arms to Russian ports desperate for help.  They had similar armaments, crew, assignments, and even paint jobs.  The Ulysses became the Belfast for me as I witnessed the awesome forces of nature and the brutal effects of prolonged exposure to frigid elements, sleep deprivation, death, sacrifice and just plain old fear.The ravaged and bone-weary seamen move ghostlike through day after numbing day.  Branded mutineers and traitors by the brass, they're given one last opportunity for redemption.  Escort one last ill-fated convoy from Scapa Flow, Britain's arctic sea base north and east to Murmansk.  Harangued by reconnaissance planes, U-Boats, destroyers, stuka fighters, and even threatened by the invincible German warship Tirpitz, the Ulysses gallantly accompanies her convoy ever nearer its goal.My second trip brought me back to the Belfast.  I didn't pay to go on the tour again.  I didn't need to.  In my mind I could envision every nook and cranny.  From the Tower Bridge I gazed at the beautiful ship and remembered the Ulysses.Don't read this book unless you plan on leaving a part of yourself in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.",

The HMS Ulysses is a British light cruiser taking part in a large supply convoy making the dreaded Murmansk run from England to the Soviet Union.  The ship's crew is already stressed and on edge from mistreatment and near-mutiny.  Now they must contend with ever present dangers like Nazi U-boats and Luftwaffe attacks, not to mention equal (or greater) danger from the angry ocean.  As the crew realizes, stricken ships and their crew can rarely be rescued because the other ships must keep moving or share a similar fate.  Of course, how long could a sailor survive in those frigid waters anyway?  Among the memorable characters are Captain Vallery, an ill but duty-driven man, and more than one ordinary seaman that define duty and bravery.  Readers feel as if they are there aboard the ship as they dare angry seas, fog, and ever-present danger of Nazi U-boats, surface ships, and Luftwaffe.  This was the first novel by Alistair MacLean (1922-1987), a worthy, fast-paced naval thriller.For those that don't know, the Murmansk run brought vital war supplies from the USA and Britain to Soviet Russia, but it involved a hazardous sailing trip from Britain and up around Nazi-occupied Norway.  After reading this book (as a teen), I met a veteran of those death-defying runs, and his face expressed many memories of his harrowing experience.",

In fact, quite the opposite.  I found that  quality curiously delightful in spite of the common writings of the period.  We had just gotten out of Korea then, and would be soon embracing for  Vietnam. My sympathy went sky-high for the sailers.  Mr. MacLean did a  great job 'humanizing' the characters.  I was compelled to care for them,  worry about them hope with their hopes and be sad with their sorrow..  Mr.  MacLean gave us details of the ship with extreme delicacy.  I could see the  curves of this great ship; the outlines of her guns, the water furrow off  her bow and the sillouettes of the enemy's planes but I never was burdened  with macro-intensive, semi-relevant details typical of military writers.  I  was never bored with the descriptions and always sad when she (the ship)  was damaged. This is a good read.  If you've ever wondered what life aboard  a military vessell was in WW2; ever wondered what men thought that were  facing death over and over again and how they dealt with (or didn't deal  with it), then this is a story for you.  I think it breeds the imagination  very well. This really is good movie material.",

There is no glamour here, just the story of a ship and its crew that is sent time and again on what was probably the worse convoys of the war. Alistait Maclean brilliantly portrays a crew that are desperately tired, have endured incessant attacks from the enemy in the near permanentdaylight of the Northern latitudes. Add the numbing cold from which there was no escape, the reader begins to feel the feeling of desperation, tiredness and resentment of the crew. Why us every time? One of the strengths of this book is the superb creation of the principle characters, especialy Captain Vallery. A veteran seaman who was pulled out of retirement to command a modern light cruiser, a perfect fighting machine, but crewed by men who were starting to perform their duties like zombies. Vallery's loyalty to his men was reciprocated by his crew.Simply put, this is the story of men on the very brink, men who only keep going  because of their captain, a captain who, like his ship is slowly dying.",

The quality of the writing , measured by its flow and and the atmosphere/images it generates, jumps at you from the very first page with the meeting and showdown in Scapa Flow.The characters are very well drawn, even Commander Orr whom we meet in person for just a few seconds but one empathises with him from the descriptions of his actions and his signals throughout the book. One image that will remain with me is of the Stirling in the last quarter of the book. Why/how can I become so emotional about what normally would seem to be an inanimate object? It can only be due to the quality of the writing.There's been discussion about making a film. The time to do that was several decades ago, dare one say when the world was filmed in black and white. My suggestion is to read this book then watch 'The Cruel Sea'. I can't imagine the present generation of 'Hollywood' actors conveying the stresses and resolve of Alistair Maclean's characters and we certainly do not need whiz-bang CGI special effects. This is a book about gritty determination and strength of character; those of us who have never served in the Armed Forces should learn a lot of life's lessions from it.",

  "reviewText": "MacLean's HMS Ulysses is a classic book of man against man but more importantly, man against the sea.  Set in the brutal Murmansk Run, this book is an account of the men of a ship marked out from the rest of the Royal Navy by a resistance to discipline.  The crew is rebelling against mindless authority but is still ready to do its duty - along the lines of the great Mutiney of 1797, when ships of the Royal Navy effectively deposed brutal and mindless officers but always maintained that it would up anchor and fight any attackers.  The men of Ulysses strike me as linear descendants of the sailors fighting Napoleon's fleet.There is a great cross section of British society in the officers and men of Ulysses; from aristocratic flag officers to gentleman rankers in the lower rates.  Petty tyrants and officers one would gladly follow anywhere.  MacLean has included them all and made it work to perfection in his tale.THe constant theme is not the brutality of war, or men killing each other, but the constant battle with the sea in all its many forms.  MacLean's attention to detail gives an almost 'you are there' quality to his writing.  The reader feels he is right there on the bow of Ulysses as it gets underway for one more run to Murmansk, to being on the bridge in her ultimate engagement with the German Navy.  You can almost feel the bone breaking cold whenever you are placed out on deck.  MacLean puts you right in the middle of it.If any of MacLean's books deserve to be made into movies, this is one that is long overdue.I found this book to be one that I didn't want to put down.  I felt the charecters were all extremely well developed, men that were almost real.  I don't know if MacLean was in the Royal Navy during World War II, but reading this book, I certainly get that impression.  This is a classic in Naval literature.",

Much different.I had an uncle who commanded an escort in the North Atlantic, and went to Murmansk at least once.  His view of the book, which he recommended to me, was that it was perfect in every detail.While there is the suggestion that MacLean puts together everything that could happen to a convoy, and happened to some or many of them at one time or another, into one story, the fact is that it remains perfectly feasible that the convoy is hit by unbelievable Arctic storms, air attacks, submarine attacks, and a surface raider.Some books write of cold, but if you read this book, you will be cold.  Some write of fatigue.  If you read this book, your eyes will burn and your face will feel as if it's sliding off your head.  Some write of despair.  If you read this book, you will understand going on and on despite there being no hope simply because that's what you've been doing.MacLean's characters make mistakes. The admiral orders a tactical turn which results in several ships being torpedoed.  He realizes that his tactics are old and predictable.  The Germans set him up because he was not sufficiently aggressive with himself.  An officer orders guns to fire before the tompions are out and several men are killed.  This is the way it is.  War involves, among other things, a sharp and determined enemy who will mess you up and use yourself against you.Kipling refers to \"the drowsy second's lack of thought that costs a dozen dead\" in a poem referring to adolescent naval officers in WW I.  These are men who should be hospitalized but instead are forced to operate on overdrive every moment of every day with no relief in sight.In other books, you will read of the immense tonnage of war materials brought to the USSR during the war. The numbers stagger the imagination.  This book explains the cost.  Good men.  Good men, all.  All gone.Read this for entertainment.  Read it to know how much you owe to men you've never heard of.",

There was no armour plate for him or rapid-fire Oerlikon guns, just a few out-dated machines guns, and the selfish hope that it would happen to someone else. He could not outrun the bombers or the torpedo, a little zig-zagging was the most he could manage, and pray that his colleagues in the destroyers and other warships would look after them, and that his engineer would keep the steam pressure up.His enemies were the German Navy and AirForce, and the incessant Arctic weather. There was no hiding place, or port of respite, the supplies had to get through, the ammunition, oil, guns and tanks - the bricks and mortar of war. If the merchant ships sank, soldiers were left unable to fight or planes could not take off - these thoughts were always in the sailors' minds. It was always the sacrifice of the few for the good of the many.The crews of these warships were the forgotten heroes, toiling in the cold, damp, dark chambers of these warships, stoking the boilers, minding the pumps, carrying the ammunition; knowing that in the event of a leak, the hatches would be sealed above them, and the would drown or suffocate, whilst they were separated from torpedoes and gunshells by a thin layer of steel, instant death was a second away. The admirals and captains got the fame and credit, but it was paid for by the flesh and blood of the ratings and those marines who volunteered to serve aboard.This book just tells it like it was.",

  "reviewText": "The HMS Ulysses was built for one mission - escorting convoys from Scotland to Murmansk in Russia to deliver supplies Russia needs to keep the Wehrmacht on the run on the eastern front. By 1943, the tide of the war had turned against the Axis on every front but the Atlantic. Worn down by the arctic storms, by constant attacks from German subs, dive bombers and cruisers, by outbreaks of TB and the constant threat of the mighty Battleship Tirpitz, Ulysses is a ship coming apart at the seams. The only thing holding the crew and ship together is there respect for its young and ailing captain and the desperation of the allied war effort. Their superiors in Admiralty would gladly supply less outdated escorts with more experienced crews, or replace their undersized (and outgunned) escort jeep carriers with fleet aircraft carriers - if that were available. But disintegrate the ship does, under attack by u-boats, Hipper-class cruisers, Condor bombers and the ceaseless assault of the Arctic. McLean does a superlative job taking both crew and vaunted ship apart. While he doesn't glorify war, he doesn't stoop at taking cheap shots at those who lead the war-effort either, and those who made critical decisions leading up to the tragedy of convoy &quot;PQ-17&quot; are given their due. (don't worry if you don't know a thing about PQ-17 - McLean gives aperfect intro). Neither does McLean stoop to gory effects. &quot;Ulysses&quot; neither glorifies war nor condemns it with cheap tactics. The horrors of war are enough for that, and McLean's prose do that - sort of like &quot;Private Ryan&quot; at sea....",

He had never heard of the book, though he was familiar with the author.I commended the title to him, and have since re-read it myself. It remains one of the most fraught and depressing, but extraordinarily compelling, novels of naval warfare I've read. MacLean's character development - like the detail and minutiae of the wartime nautical world on the Murmansk run - is intense and complete, even as the characters die from the myriad perils that surround them.This is an epic story of men's ability to endure, the indifference of the sea and the weather, and the stark cruellty of war.",

Thought it would be interesting, as my father had been in the Royal Navy during WWII and did North Atlantic Convoy runs, similar but not quite as cold as the Artic Convoys described in HMS Ulysses to supply Russia with much needed medical and military armaments.From the very begining of the book to the end it was gripping, I devoured it.The constant tension, hardship and vigilence, the weakness and courage of each character was awesome, not a word I frequently use but this story is awesome.We follow the H.M.S.Ulysses on her last Artic Convoy, before promised deployment in the Mediterranean. Nothing goes as planned despite the senior officers capabilities. The unrelenting cold, poor nutrition, disease and psychological stress just keep on coming. The characters are plausable, fully realized and capable of truely heroic actions, while being vulnerable and very human. No amount of planning, training or experience is possible for the unexpected that they find in this, harshest of conditions.It's not an easy read but I think it's his best novel, I've recommened it to all my family and friends.I know this story and it's characters will stay with me for a very, very long time.",

Not bad, you understand, but familiar.This book, however, is completely different. Mr Maclean served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and took part in several convoys similar to those described in this book. His experiences have coloured his writing and given this book an immediacy and a depth that the others lack.

  "reviewText": "This thriller novel kicks off with Dr. Carpenter, a British medical doctor, who gets orders to board the USS Dolphin in the UK. The US nuclear submarine Dolphin has a near-impossible mission: it has to cruise underneath the ice pack of the Arctic to find and save the inhabitants of Ice Station Zebra, a scientific meteorological station drifting with the ice pack somewhere north of the Arctic Circle. Ice Station Zebra was destroyed by a fire, but little does anyone know that fire at Ice Station Zebra was due to sabotage, and that one of the survivors is a ruthless killer. Furthermore, Dr. Carpenter is not what he seems to be and it later becomes evident that he has more staked in this cruise than originally suggested.What I liked about the story is how Alistair MacLean demonstrated his writing ability and mastery of the genre to create an atmosphere that gets the reader to feel that he/she is also inside the submarine and can sense, feel, smell and experience the conflict, fear and tension on board the submarine. Definitely not as turbo-paced as Matthew Reilly's more modern thriller novel with a nearly similar name, Ice Station, MacLean's book does not lack in pace, but the pace is controlled to such a degree that the right amount of suspense is created and that the tension builds up as the story progresses. Reilly's Ice Station is more about countless pages of jet-propelled action and relentless mindless violence, whereas MacLean's Ice Station Zebra consists of the finesse of expert handling of suspense, intrigue and tension.Although the dialogue may be more reminiscent of the era that the book was written in, this is truly still a masterpiece of the thriller genre and can almost serve as a template for thriller writers, where you have a plot stripped of all the unnecessary fluff that so many modern thrillers suffer from, which only serves to increase the page count and nothing much else.",

Doctor Jolly, a  heavily accented Brit will be the man Carpenter is looking for.  This man  is a professional spy who covers his tracks quite well. Captain Swanson is  the leading officer on the submarine Dolphin where most of the action  including the climax takes place.  He seems to be an inteligent man and  well respected, but seems easily manipulated by Carpenter.  One incident i  did not like, it was shortly after Carpenter arrived at Ice Station Zebra  in which he found his brothers charred remains, however he seemed to show  little or no emotion towards this faceless body.  I Would not reccomend  this book because of impersonable characters who i could not relate with.  The characters in my opinion are truly the backbone of the story and  without them there is truly no hope for ICE STATION ZEBRA!",

If you have seen the film, you should still find the novel enjoyable as it departs significantly from the later screenplay. Released just months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Ice Station Zebra borrows its premise from a real life incident involving early spy satelites, and sets its story mainly on board a submarine at the time when arctic undersea exploration was in the news. Don't expect a warm and fuzzy ride. Ice Station Zebra is as chilly as its Arctic setting. I found it tense and exciting, even if the characters were never well defined. Maclean's fans will find familar reading. A cool central protagonist embarks on a desparate mission, beset by a host of vague characters, not all of whom are trustworthy. With aspects of Arctic survival stories and Hollywood submarine movies, Ice Station Zebra, is more whodunnit than cold war spy novel, but a good read just the same.",

Readers accustomed to modern thrillers that bolt out of the gate at 100 miles an hour should bear in mind this was written about 35 years ago when authors were allowed to build up tension. A mysterious British specialist boards a U.S. submarine that has been urgently dispatched to figure out what has happened to Ice Station Zebra, a top secret base drifting on ice near the North Pole. After many travails the specialist reaches the burned out station and quickly figures out that one of the nine survivors deliberately set the fire and murdered some of his colleagues. The survivors all board the submarine, which experiences a string of suspicious accidents, deaths and disasters. The idea is a good one but MacLean's characters are little more than one-dimensional.

However, this book was the second MacLean novel I read, and thus the plot was completely new to me and fortunately, utterly original for MacLean.  I was interested in the film version (this is much better) and was trying to find out what the storyline was.  I had previously read Where Eagles Dare which I had found to be tasteful.  Ice Station Zebra blew me away.  I did not know at first what kind of book I was reading.  I assumed that it was an action-adventure flick like Where Eagles Dare.  It's not.  It's much more.  There is only one person shot in the entire book, but this is not the conflict.  The conflict lies in fighting against the cold, a death of drowning, and an invisible enemy who is stalking you at every step.  Like another reviewer said, this book shows that a legitimately good spy novel can be made without gratuitous violence and sex.  There is no female element is this novel (sorry ladies) and the violence is realistic, yet not overdone.  One of the things I loved about this novel is the way MacLean tells the story in the 1rst person, but still manages to not let us know everything that is going on in the main character's head.  Thrilling read.  Crisp Dialogue.  The Perfect novel.  Nothing was lacking.  One of those few books that I have read more than once, and it never gets old.",

His announced mission is to organize the rescue of the crew of a British meteorological station on an ice island in the Arctic, victims of a deadly fire.  As with many MacLean novels, neither the leading characters nor the mission are quite what they appear to be.\"Ice Station Zebra\" traces the Dolphin's exciting run under the polar ice pack to reach the last know location of Ice Station Zebra.  There, Dr. Carpenter and a group of volunteers from the crew of Dolphin will dare the weather and the ice pack to find the station and rescue its stricken crew.  Carpenter quickly discovers that the fire at Ice Station Zebra was no accident; among the surviving members of the Ice Station is a ruthless killer who will stop at nothing, including holding at risk the Dolphin, to achieve his mysterious purpose.  Carpenter himself proves to have a very personal stake in the outcome of the struggle with the killer.  MacLean's brisk prose and sardonic dialogue keep the suspense crackling to the very last page.By the time he wrote \"Ice Station Zebra\", MacLean had become a highly proficient story-teller.  If parts of this novel seem a little contrived, the wise reader will relax and enjoy the ride.

Within a few pages, we know the gritty world of the submarine, the hard-bitten men who serve in her, and the intense preoccupation of Carpenter, the narrator, who has both a professional and personal stake in discovering the fate of the ice station and the secret technology. MacLean is outstanding when he writes about jeopardy, and the men and the sub are in constant danger throughout the book.I found the resolution of the mystery very disappointing and substandard, straight out of an old Columbo in which the rumpled detective assembled the suspects in a room and then talked us through the unlikely scenario that made that person the murderer. It was made even worse by the fact that I guessed who the killer was on the very first page in which the character appeared.For that reason, I couldn't really recommend this particular book, though I am a fan of the author and plan to read more of his thrillers in the future.Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark\"",

MacLean, while short on fleshing out characters, is exceptional at action and moving the story along at a brisk pace. Throughout this novel, even though I had an idea of what was going to happen, and even guessed some of the mysteries (don't want to spoil it for others), I enjoyed it immensely. This is not a by the numbers espionage novel, where the big 'reveals' are the only payoffs.The story centers around a station set up in the Arctic, where a meteorological station has been established, but is in trouble and is sending out SOS and so the US sends a nuclear submarine under the ice to rescue them. Along the way, there is sabotage, harrowing fascinating moments of finding a place to break through the ice and pure adventure. I loved this part of the novel, when they were trying to find the drifting station.There are surprises and of course there are people who aren't what they appear, aka spies, which drives the final half of the novel to a very satisfying conclusion. Particularly frightening was a fire on the sub.I studied on a sub so I found it to be very realistic and innovative. MacLean clearly did his homework.Highly recommended!",

Suffice to say, MacLean's novel is much better in terms of plot, suspense and coherence. The scriptwriters were morons, they should have stayed with MacLean's plot. The movie changes the ending and, again, the ending is better in the book. So if you've seen the film, don't think everything in the book is the same. It's not.MacLean seemed to feel at home in the Arctic. Several of his novels take place in the icy area and he always writes about it with skill. If you are reading one of his Arctic novels, even if it's July in Florida, you will feel chilled until you put the book down.The characters are well-drawn, the plot is first-rate, the writing is excellence and the twists will keep the reading guessing. The movie theme was excellent and Patrick McGoohan had a great role as the British agent in the film, but those were the only two items noteworthy in the cinema version.It's a great cold war thriller.",

  "reviewText": "The Arctic meteorological base Drift Ice Station Zebra has suffered a catastrophic fire, with several men killed and the remainder desperately clinging to survival in the frozen wasteland. As the US Navy's latest submarine USS Dolphin prepares to make a mercy dash to Ice Station Zebra, they are joined by British doctor Neil Carpenter, an alleged expert in Arctic survival. But Carpenter is not all he seems, and it is clear that Ice Station Zebra is not all it appears to be either. Carpenter suspects that the fire was no accident, and a series of hostile acts aimed at the Dolphin convinces him that something is very far wrong. What was Ice Station Zebra's true purpose, what caused the fire that destroyed the base, and are one or more of the survivors responsible? And who is Dr Carpenter, a man who abilities go well beyond setting broken bones?`Ice Station Zebra' is one of Maclean's better books, written during the middle of his \"golden run\" in the 1950's and 60's. All of the Maclean elements are in place. The dry-witted laconic characters, with protagonist Carpenter clearly knowing more than what he is letting on. The workings of a naval vessel (in this case a submarine instead of a ship) and the men who serve in them. The Whodunnit locked room mystery set in an unusual location. And above all, the realistic and detailed descriptions of the harsh, bleak Arctic environment.  Fans of Maclean's other Arctic mysteries like `Night Without End' and `Bear Island' will find plenty to love here.There is perhaps a little less action than in some of his other books; `Ice Station Zebra' is more of a descriptive piece with mystery elements than a straight-out action thriller. But Maclean is able to use the slower pace of the book very cleverly. The mystery behind this Arctic research station, and of Carpenter himself, is revealed only gradually, with Carpenter openly admitting that he is not telling all his secrets. And the increasingly serious \"accidents\" which befall the Dolphin help set up a tension that only heightens with each new disaster. The claustrophobic environment of the submarine, along with the knowledge that the crew may be carrying a killer on board, only adds to the foreboding.After this great build-up though, the ending does let the book down just a little. While the final revelation of the purpose of Zebra and the reason for the killings is interesting enough, the revelation of the guilty party is not surprising. Although there are plenty of potential suspects, only a few of the characters from Zebra are well developed, and so you pretty much know that the killer has to be one of them. And that old plot device where the protagonist plays dumb and lures the guilty party into making a boastful confession has been used by Maclean several times before, and is a bit of a cop out really.Still, `Ice Station Zebra' is definitely one of Maclean's better efforts, and he is back in the environment that he writes about best. Four stars.",

  "reviewText": "An American nuclear-powered submarine stationed in a British base is sent up, towards the North Pole, on a fact-finding and rescue mission about a British Arctic base, the interrupted last radio message of which was an S.O.S.-Mayday one. The submarine is carrying, as a guest, an English agent who also has personal reasons of interest. It comes out that the base had been almost totally destroyed by arson. A few survivors in terminal condition from frost are found and revived; the agent solves the riddle, prevents - nay, turns around 180 degrees - the final damage, and exposes the villainous traitor during the return trip(family circumstances of personal relevance are included). This book is in key with all others by the same author: introduce a seemingly desperate situation, masterminded by a super-fiend who is usually controlled by the bad side of the Iron Curtain; enter the afore-said super-duper British Secret Service agent (a past master in 20 different languages and all of their 300 dialects, and in all crafts of his trade. The situation evolves from bad to worse, apparently with no hope, till page \" n/2 + 1 \", but Superty-Duperty keeps working at it until the devilish plot is uncovered. Final confrontation with Super-Fiend, and his utter humiliation, defeat and ruin. Down curtain, everybody stand up for \"Rule Britannia\". Read one book by this author and you've read'em all, in a \"very pompous indeed\" style of writing.",

  "reviewText": "There's an old saying. \"Write what you know.\" Alistair MacLean is Scottish, and so consequently, what he knows most is how to write British characters (and, weirdly, Germans - he tends to write them fairly well). Americans? Not so much. In fact, I've yet to encounter a believable American character in a single one of his books, and the otherwise excellent Ice Station Zebra is a good example of this.In novels such as The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare, this problem is limited because each of those books has only a single American in them, but in Ice Station Zebra, we get an entire American submarine crew, and MacLean's inability to write believable Americans becomes glaringly apparent.I don't mean their personalities and motivations - I mean their dialogue. Every time an American character opens their mouth, nothing they say rings true. Everything from how they phrase things to their banter to their word choices, is distinctly British. It reads like MacLean has never met any American servicemen, and wrote their dialogue based solely on what he'd experienced living in the UK. The end result is a bunch of American submariners who sound like British guys.While the novel, overall, is excellent (suspenseful, exciting, etc.), I think it's obvious that MacLean bit off more than he could chew by trying to write an entire American submarine crew. He should've just had them be British.",

Anyone writing a thriller today would  do well to read this novel and realize that true writing does not require  heavy amounts of sick, glossy violence and unneccessary sex.

  "reviewText": "Ice Station Zebra, an arctic meteorological station, located on the ever drifting pack ice of the high Arctic, has been destroyed by an equipment fire. The Dolphin, an American nuclear submarine, is about to set sail on a dangerous high speed mission under the polar ice cap to rescue the badly injured team.  But, just as one would suspect from a cold war thriller, all is not as it seems. Ice Station Zebra is a good deal more than just a scientific meteorological station. The scientific team is not just a collection of scientists. One of them is a ruthless killer for which the achievement of his mysterious secret mission against the Americans and the Brits may even require the cold-blooded execution of the entire crew of the Dolphin. Nor is Doctor Carpenter, a British volunteer member of the Dolphin's crew ostensibly along to seek out his brother who was part of Ice Station Zebra's stricken team, precisely what he shows to the world.As thrillers go, \"Ice Station Zebra\" is certainly enjoyable but it's a long, long way from what most readers would label a compelling page turner. It's got all the requisite ingredients to be sure - murder, sabotage, hidden identities, spies, accidents, cliff-hangers - but I think it could have been so much more. The parts of the story that took place inside the submarine were interesting and, at times, even exciting. But the action never reached the breathless urgent pace that was more recently achieved in other submarine thrillers such as \"Hunt for Red October\" or Larry Bond's \"Dangerous Ground\". The Arctic itself as an environment which can be stunning in its breathtaking beauty and is always fraught with danger and the potential for deadly accidents was never truly exploited as a part of the story to anywhere near the extent that it might have been.\"Ice Station Zebra\" is an enjoyable change of pace and nice easy brain candy reading that won't tax the little grey cells. It just won't make anyone's top ten list of the best all-time spy vs spy thrillers!Recommended.Paul Weiss",

What it does have, to an exceptional degree, is vivid  characterization, enjoyable writing, and a sustained build-up of tension  that enables the reader to miss the occasional hole in the plot.  Something  I truly love about this book is that there is no fat on its frame: no  gratuitous violence, zero sex, no hype.  In some ways it strikes me as a  model for the successful thriller in its purest form, with everything  potentially inessential stripped away, and I re-read it every year or two  just for the sheer fun of it.",

I had been promising to buy and read the novel for many years now, and finally decided that this year's summer vacation was the ideal time.I honestly wish I'd never bothered.The writing in the first part of the book is so slow I almost gave up. The characters are not believable and the situation is unconvincing and farcically so by turns.I'm not by any means a demanding reader but in light of my finally reading the book I have to say it is a mystery to me why anyone would option it for a film. The story as written could not be filmed due to suspension of disbelief problems and hackneyed and unbelievable \"I know what's going on but I'm not going to tell you just yet\" behavior of the guest aboard the submarine, used to keep the story going because without that it would collapse around itself.I recommend people stick to the film for the best telling of the events at Ice Station Zebra.",
